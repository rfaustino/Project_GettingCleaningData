Project_GettingCleaningData
===========================

This repository include the following files:
-- run_analysis.R: The R file with the code necessary to implement the projec and create a tidy data set;
-- CodeBook.md: a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to clean up the data;
-- README.md: this file;


The run_analysis.R script does the following. 
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
